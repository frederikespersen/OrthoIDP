# Experiments

## Description
This directory contains data from separate experiments, each with its own `.ipynb` notebook for orchestrating data preparation and analysis.


## Contents
This directory contains these experiments for the thesis:
- **`initial/`**: Initial test run of 3 variants of 2 human histones (H2B, H1.0) to verify histones as a model system
- **`ortho_h1-0/`**: Single-chain simulations of orthologs of histone H1-0
- **`idpevo_h1-0/`**: Using an evolution algorithm on an average histone H1.0-sequence
- **`prota_h1-0/`**: Two-chain simulations of ProTα and wild type histone H1.0 CTD
- **`prota_variant_*/`**: Two-chain simulations of ProTα and histone H1.0 CTD variants. Variants are generated by clustering of either $\kappa$ (`_k`), $R_g$ (`_rg`) or both (`_comb`)

This directory also contains additional side experiments:
- **`para_h1/`**: Single-chain simulations of human histone H1 paralogs
- **`e1a_linkers/`**: Recreating the work of González-Foulet [Nature, 2022] using CALVADOS2
- **`comp_cons_search/`**: Investigating the conservation of size by chain compaction using IDRome


## Experiment content
Each experiment is structured as:
- **`<experiment>/**`**: Files from a specific experiment
    - **`data/`**: Input data for simulations and analysis
    - **`results/`**: Output data from simulations (*.gitignored*)
    - `<experiment>.ipynb`: Notebook for orchestrating data and analysis
    - `<experiment>.json`: Metadata on experiment (See below)
    - `submit*.sh`: SLURM submission script(s)


## Experiment metadata
Metadata on the IDR sequences used for the experiment is stored in .json files named like the experiment (i.e. `~/exp/initial/initial.json`).

The file has the following schema:
- `templates`: The intrinsically disordered proteins to use for the analysis
    - `<protein_id>`: A custom identifier to be use for the protein and its variants
        - `uniprot_id`: The UniProt ID to use for the protein
        - `name`: The name of the protein in UniProt
        - `description`: The description of the protein in UniProt
        - `species`: The species from which the protein originates
        - `sequence`: The full protein sequence
- `data`: Metadata on the input data
    - `<sequence_id>`: Like `<protein_id>`, but sometimes with a suffix if several variants exists
        - `template`: The template `<protein_id>` for the sequence
        - `sequence`: The sequence in the .fasta file with the corresponding `<sequence_id>`
        - `region`: The general location of the extracted IDR, like NTD, CTD, or INT (Internal)
        - `location`: The precise location of the IDR in the full length protein
        - `variant`: Which variant of the `<protein_id>` that is used
